# Learn Polars

_ðŸš§ This collection is a work in progress. Please help us add notebooks!_

This collection of marimo notebooks is designed to teach you the basics of data wrangling using a Python library called Polars.

**Planned notebooks.**

Any notebook with the status "ðŸš§" needs a contributor! Please file an issue if you plan to contribute.
